        <b>#1:</b> Develop a history of success and proof of concepts that led to better returns than that which can be obtained in broader investment instruments (i.e., DJI or SPX). As of writing the DJI has returned -0.29% over the last 52 weeks. Not us.  
      </div>
      <div class="bet-1-description"> 
This will be achieved via a published history of holdings and results of newly developed quantitative models. Space Capital LLC does not adhere to strictly long term investments.

        <b>#2:</b> Acquire first round of funding & begin first term. 
      </div>
      <div class="bet-1-description"> 
Once (#1) is adequately expressed, we will obtain initial funds. The first round of funding must gather at minimum 100,000 USD,  but one million is ideal. In fact, all else that follows will be on the assumption of one million being raised. Investments will occur over 18 month terms. During this time, clients cannot withdraw their money unless: (i) the funds raised lose X% or (ii) bonus levels are surpassed. The value identified as 'X' as well along with the bonus levels will be agreed upon prior to the term's beginning. Thus, clients consent risk for a fraction of their initial investment to invest with us at zero cost until a bonus level is achieved. The lowest tier bonus level will be determined by the average of returns of the SPX and DJI over the 18 month time period. Any bonus level at or beyond a 100% growth of the initial funds results in half the total returns being split equally amongst the two owners. For example, 700,000 USD is retained by Space Capital if the fund is valued at 2.4 million after 18 months (assuming one million initially raised).

        <b>#3:</b> After a successful (#2), any client whom was a part of Round 1 may invest with Space Capital at no cost as their trust was essential to our development. That is, bonus levels no longer apply to Round 1 clients; they only risk losses and can withdraw their money at anytime unlike initial clients. Furthermore, a successful first term will allow an employee to be hired to help with web development and social media. With this, we will acquire new clients and proceed with similar agreements as those in Round 1.    
      </div>
      <div class="bet-1-description"> 
Managing anything less than 10,000,000 USD five years after the first term begins would be considered to be a failure.
